# Number game

The other evening, while returning from Ahmedabad ni Gufa with my friends, the conversations turned to Reddit's popular ```number game```. It hit that how boring it would be to manually select a number every time. I mean, selecting a number also makes your intentions clear about what you want to know about the other person (irrespective of whether you want to).Â Took a few hours to read about Python's [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) library and voila here it is. Pretty basic script.

While making this, I got a sense of the assisting abilities of LLMs like ChatGPTs and how great (I hope) they will turn out to be in the future. I first used an OCR to text website to get all the questions in text, and then I used ChatGPT to turn them into JSON.
